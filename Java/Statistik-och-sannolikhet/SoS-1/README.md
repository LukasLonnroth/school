# Weather Statistics

In this project, there is a JSON file (weather.json) containing temperature, wind and air humidity values
per hour from 18.9.2008 to 11.2.2016 measured by Arcadas own weather station.

The goal of this project was to write a Java-program that reads this file and calculates:

* Minimum, maximum, and average temperature for all measurement values
* The highest measured wind force and its time
* Average annual temperature for each full year (ie 2009 - 2015)
* Standard deviation of the measured temperature values monthly for a given year
